                        <strong>Local storage</strong>
                        is a web storage method that helps us store data on the clientâ€™s computer in the form of
                        key/value pairs in a web browser. The data is stored in local storage for a lifetime unless the
                        user manually deletes it from the browser. It does not expire even when the user closes the
                        window or tab. Instead, the data remains in the browser until and unless the browser's memory is
                        cleared.
                        <br>
                        <strong>Session storage</strong> is very similar to the local storage. Still, the main
                        difference lies in the lifespan as it persists in the browser until its current tab is on. Once
                        you close the tab or terminate it, the data on session storage also gets lost. We can also set
                        and retrieve its data using setItem() and getItem() methods, respectively, similar to the local
                        storage methods.

                        does limit overflow.
